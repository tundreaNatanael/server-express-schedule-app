### Running Cypress Tests

Cypress tests in this project are focused only on the user routes.

**Note:** Some tests are intentionally set to fail. This demonstrates the importance of thoroughly testing your API routes with Cypress, as it helps identify issues and ensures your endpoints behave as expected.

You can run Cypress tests using the following scripts:

- To run all Cypress tests in headless mode:

  ```bash
  npm run cypress:run
  ```

- To open the Cypress Test Runner in interactive mode:
  ```bash
  npm run cypress:open
  ```
